Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection using Vocal Data

### Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by increasing neuronal deterioration, particularly in dopamine-producing areas of the brain. This leads to both motor and non-motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, stiffness, and speech difficulty. Speech difficulty, in particular, has emerged as a significant marker for identifying Parkinson's disease, affecting various aspects of speech including vocal quality, pronunciation, fluency, and prosody.

This project aims to explore the efficacy of SVM algorithms for PD identification using voice data. By leveraging objective data analysis techniques, this study contributes to refining diagnostic procedures, facilitating early detection, and improving disease management strategies.

### Objectives
- Evaluate ML techniques for PD diagnosis using vocal data.
- Identify key findings in ML-based PD classification.
- Assess ML effectiveness in differentiating PD from healthy individuals.
- Examine challenges in ML-based PD diagnosis.
- Explore implications for diagnostic tools and early detection.
- Discuss future research directions in ML for PD diagnosis.
